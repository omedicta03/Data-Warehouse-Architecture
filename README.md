# Data Warehouse Architecture for Healthcare

This repository contains information and resources related to the **Data Warehouse Architecture for Healthcare** project. The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive data warehouse that facilitates database analytics, reporting services, and data-driven insights to improve clinical and operational performance.

## **Objective**
The primary aim is to design and implement a scalable data warehouse architecture that:
- Consolidates data from multiple sources, including Electronic Health Records (EHR), claims data, operational databases, and external datasets.
- Provides reliable metrics for performance improvement, with a focus on the 1115 Medicaid Waiver DPP and other healthcare projects.
- Supports visualization and reporting to inform clinical decisions and operational strategies.

## **Architecture Overview**
1. **Data Sources**:
   - Electronic Health Records (EHR)
   - Claims Data
   - Operational Databases
   - 1115 Medicaid Waiver DPP Data
   - External Sources (e.g., public health and research databases)

2. **Data Integration**:
   - **ETL Processes** using SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to extract, transform, and load data.
   - Ensure data quality and standardization during the transformation stage.

3. **Data Storage**:
   - Staging area and primary data warehouse implemented with SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
   - Specialized data marts for clinical, operational, and financial areas created using SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS).

4. **Data Modeling**:
   - Star schema design for fact and dimension tables (e.g., `PatientDim`, `ProviderDim`, `TreatmentFact`).
   - Support for Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) to capture program-specific changes.

5. **Data Access & Visualization**:
   - Use of tools like Power BI and Tableau to create:
     - Interactive dashboards (e.g., clinical performance, operational efficiency, and compliance tracking).
     - Drill-down and geographical visualizations for detailed insights.

6. **Data Quality & Documentation**:
   - Rigorous validation processes for data accuracy.
   - Comprehensive documentation for ETL workflows, data models, and program requirements.

## **Project Phases**
1. **Requirements Gathering**:
   Engage stakeholders to document data needs and reporting requirements.

2. **Design**:
   Develop technical specifications, architecture diagrams, and process workflows.

3. **Development**:
   Build ETL processes, create data models, and design visualizations.

4. **Deployment**:
   Implement the data warehouse, data marts, and reporting tools; train end-users.

5. **Maintenance**:
   Monitor, optimize, and update ETL processes, models, and dashboards regularly.

## **Key Features**
- **Scalable Architecture:** Designed to handle increasing healthcare data needs.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** User-friendly dashboards for clinical and administrative use.
- **High Data Quality:** Consistent validation ensures accurate and reliable insights.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Source-to-target mappings, processes, and requirements are thoroughly documented.
